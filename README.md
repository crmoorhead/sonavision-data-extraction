# Image Extraction from Sonavision Data Files

The data files PDF details how the data is extracted from the the files generated by the Sonavision software recording the SV1010 and how those files were deciphered. This readme will give some documentation for the functions written in the code. 

__experiment_loader(dir_name)__: Takes an argument of the path of a directory containing all the scan data files. The output is a dictionary with the file names as keys and an array containing the corresponding raw data as values.

__file_settings(file)__: Takes an array associated with a file name keyword from the experiment loader dictionary and prints recording information to the screen. This includes and changes in the settings made withing the duration of the recording. This includes settings for scan speed, scan mode, scan frequency, resolution, range and other relevant details.

__print_stats(data)__: This produces an abridged version of the file_settings function above, with the same input. It makes the assumption that the settings were not changed during the recording session.

__data_slices(data,\*args)__: Returns the scan mode as the first output and an array of extracted data with irrelevant information discarded as the second output. The mode will be an integer (this is how it is stored n the original data) to be understood as follows: Stop/Sidescan (0), Sector Scan (1), Flyback (2), Rotate (3). The data slices array is a list of lists with each list starting with the angle at the current time step followed by the intensities of the responses from the area closest to the scanner up until the full range. The data portion will be of length 400 at all scan speeds except for Super Fast where it is 200.

__preprocess_data_slices(data_slices,\*args)__: 

__forb(a,b,jump)__:

__block_extractor(data_slices,mode)__:

__flip_merge(test ?)__:

__dir_in_b(a,b,base)__:

__sort_mod(sorted_list,jump)__:

__sort_lists_mod(list,jump)__:

__flip_merge_data(test_data)__:

__flip_anticlockwise(data_blocks)__:

__get_limits(data_blocks)__:

__block_generator(blocks, depth, limits, sparity, jitter, empty)__:

__linear_interp(list1,list2,intervals)__:

__pad(data_blocks, limits, mode)__:

__image_format(full_data_blocks,\*args)__:

__images_from_data(file_array, \*args)__:

__process_directory(source_dir, target_dir)__:
